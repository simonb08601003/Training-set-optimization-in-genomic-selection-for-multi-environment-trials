  Genotype-by-environment interaction (G×E) is a key factor in plant breeding, impacting multi-environment trials (METs) for accurate selection. Genomic selection (GS) can improve prediction accuracy across environments, especially with Genomic best linear unbiased prediction (GBLUP) models that account for G×E effects. This study evaluates training set optimization using two coefficient of determination (CD) criteria and compares them to random selection based on the ability to identify elite varieties. 
  A genetic algorithm identified optimal training sets from three datasets of rice (_Oryza sativa_ L.), barley (_Hordeum vulgare_ L.), and maize (_Zea mays_ L.), and their performance was assessed using normalized discounted cumulative gain (NDCG), Spearman’s rank correlation (SRC), and rank sum ratio (RS<sub>ratio</sub>). CD-based training sets showed better performance among these evaluation metrics. The performance of the two CD criteria were compared. CD<sub>mean(v2)</sub> outperformed CD<sub>mean.MET</sub> in SRC and RS<sub>ratio</sub> especially in larger training set sizes. Therefore, CD<sub>mean(v2)</sub> was highly recommended to select training sets in multi-environment trials.
